## Disclaimer

For all intents and purposes, this Library is for personal use. It is much more of a learning experience than a large scale usable alternative for other Libraries.
If you choose to use this, expect bugs, expect not-so-userfriendly features, and expect things to break. I will try my best to fix issues as they come up, but encourage you to work on it yourself.
If you want something that is not included in the library, write it yourself. Open a PR or not, does not matter. Learn from it, so will I.
